# React.js Todo List
 A Todo app I made following a tutorial then modified it with the following changes:

 * changed the input fonts. I really didnt like the blocky font - done
 * added a title - done
 * added a light dark toggle - done
 * made it so light dark mode persist through refreshing the page - done
 * added ability to move tasks up and down - done
 * fixed input so you can't add an empty todo - done
 * see if I can make the edit functionality better
